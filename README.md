# Profiler Release 2

## Description

The Project Profiler Backend Service is a RESTful API designed to facilitate efficient data management for the Profiler project.
This service offers a comprehensive set of HTTP methods to enable seamless interaction with data.
The primary purpose of this backend service is to handle data validation, storage, and retrieval,
ensuring the integrity and accessibility of information.

### Features

* **Data Manipulation**: The service provides endpoints for various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to perform actions on the data associated with the Profiler project.

* **Validation**: Robust data validation mechanisms are in place to ensure that incoming data meets the required criteria before being processed. This helps maintain data quality and consistency.

* **Database Integration**: The backend service seamlessly integrates with a database to persistently store data. This ensures that information is retained even after server restarts or failures.

* **RESTful Architecture**: Built on REST principles, the service offers a standardized and predictable interface for communication. Resources are logically organized, and HTTP methods correspond to specific actions.
